# lifelog

A Flutter journal app — learning project with a full reference implementation.

## Project layout

```
lifelog/      ← working project (implement features here)
reference/    ← complete reference implementation + Widgetbook
docs/         ← step-by-step learning guides
Makefile      ← dev helpers
```

## Running the app

```bash
# Working project
cd lifelog && flutter run

# Reference implementation
cd reference && flutter run

# Widgetbook component browser
cd reference && flutter run -t widgetbook/main.dart
```

## Component screenshots (golden tests)

The `reference/test/goldens/` directory contains PNG screenshots of every
component, generated by Flutter's golden test framework and committed to the repo
so they're browsable on GitHub.

```bash
make goldens          # regenerate all PNGs
make test-goldens     # verify no visual regressions
make goldens-docker   # regenerate via Docker (cross-platform safe)
```

See [docs/golden-tests.md](docs/golden-tests.md) for full details.

## Learning guides

Step-by-step guides in `docs/code-guide/` walk through building the app from scratch.
